# Charts - How to obtain values calculated for automatic axis date-time scale modes

This example demonstrates how you can obtain the values calculated for an axis' date-time grid alignment and measure unit properties which are read-only, when automatic axis date-time scale modes are used.

## Example Overview

Handle the [ChartControl.AxisScaleChanged](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraCharts.ChartControl.AxisScaleChanged) ([WebChartControl.AxisScaleChanged](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/DevExpress.XtraCharts.Web.WebChartControl.AxisScaleChanged)) event to access the axis itself and customize its properties.

## Documentation

- [Axis Scale Types](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/5799/controls-and-libraries/chart-control/axes/axis-scale-types)
- [Data Aggregation](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/6247/controls-and-libraries/chart-control/data-representation/data-aggregation)
